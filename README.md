### About me
My strong passion for IT led me to start a Fullstack Web Developer bootcamp in November 2022. At the moment I have completed it, but I am dedicating myself to reinforce the concepts learned in six months in order to consolidate my knowledge and also to explore new languages and technologies.
I'm currently avaiable for positions as a Frontend Web Developer, in a full-remote solution or in Tuscany, Italy.
